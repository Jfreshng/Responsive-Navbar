# Responsive-Navbar
Responsive Navigation Bar using react.

# This is my first article here 
To use this piece all you need to do is create a react app. I won't be explaining how to do that here.
You can simply copy and paste this code (precisely code in the NavBar.jsx file) to any location where you need a navbar in your create project.
This should also work in Next.js simply import react in your xxx.tsx file to enjoy the useState hook.

As for the styles the index.css stlyesheet they just give your page margin using the CSS media query. You can always tweak them to your state.
The code in Navbar.jsx should work with or wothout the stylesheet.
